# Analysis of Sales by Hour and City :
![sale per country ](salecountry.png)
 **1. Top Performing City** 
* **San Francisco** clearly outperforms all other cities in total sales throughout the day. Its sales peak dramatically around **(7 PM)**, reaching close to **120,000**, which is more than double most other cities.

**2. Peak Sales Hours**
* Across **most cities**, sales start increasing around **8:00 AM**, gradually rising during the day.
* The highest sales activity generally occurs between **10:00 AM and 8:00 PM**, with sharp peaks in the late afternoon and early evening.

 **3. Low Activity Hours**
* Between **1:00 AM and 6:00 AM**, all cities show minimal sales. This is likely due to people being asleep or not engaging in online shopping during these hours.

**4. City Comparisons**
* **Los Angeles** and **New York City** follow behind San Francisco, showing strong sales in the same time (10 AM to 8 PM).
* **Austin, Portland, and Seattle** have the **lowest total sales**, and their peaks are much smaller.

**5. Interpretation**
* The **high activity in the evening (15:00‚Äì20:00)** suggests that people likely shop after work when they are at home.
* San Francisco‚Äôs dominance may reflect to : 
  * A larger or more tech-savvy customer base ( the dataset is a tech data ).
  * Greater disposable income.
  * Possibly more marketing or brand presence in that city.
### **Recommendations Based on Sales by Hour and City**

 **1. Focus Marketing Efforts on Peak Hours (15:00‚Äì20:00)**
* Run targeted ads, push notifications, and email campaigns between **3 PM and 8 PM**, when most users are actively purchasing.
* Use countdown promotions or limited-time offers during this window to create urgency.

**2. Prioritize High-Performing Cities like San Francisco**
* Increase inventory availability and delivery options in **San Francisco**, where demand is strongest.
* Consider **location-based promotions** for other top cities like **Los Angeles** and **New York City**.

**3. Boost Visibility in Underperforming Cities**
* For cities with low sales (e.g., **Austin, Portland, Seattle**), explore localized marketing strategies:
  * Collaborate with local influencers.
  * Offer city-specific discounts.
  * Translate ads or tailor messaging if needed.

**4. Optimize Website/App Performance in Evenings**
* Ensure the platform performs smoothly between **15:00 and 21:00**, as high traffic could slow down load times or cause errors, especially in key markets like San Francisco.
* Add a live chat or customer support team during these hours.

**5. Promote Products Suited for Evenings**
* Feature products often bought in the evening (e.g., home appliances, entertainment devices, phones).
* Showcase ‚ÄúWork-from-home‚Äù or ‚ÄúEvening Relaxation‚Äù bundles.
