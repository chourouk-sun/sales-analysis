# 1. Analysis of Sales by Hour and City 
![sale per country ](salecountry.png)
 **Top Performing City** 
* **San Francisco** clearly outperforms all other cities in total sales throughout the day. Its sales peak dramatically around **(7 PM)**, reaching close to **120,000**, which is more than double most other cities.

**Peak Sales Hours**
* Across **most cities**, sales start increasing around **8:00 AM**, gradually rising during the day.
* The highest sales activity generally occurs between **10:00 AM and 8:00 PM**, with sharp peaks in the late afternoon and early evening.

 **Low Activity Hours**
* Between **1:00 AM and 6:00 AM**, all cities show minimal sales. This is likely due to people being asleep or not engaging in online shopping during these hours.

**City Comparisons**
* **Los Angeles** and **New York City** follow behind San Francisco, showing strong sales in the same time (10 AM to 8 PM).
* **Austin, Portland, and Seattle** have the **lowest total sales**, and their peaks are much smaller.

**Interpretation**
* The **high activity in the evening (15:00–20:00)** suggests that people likely shop after work when they are at home.
* San Francisco’s dominance may reflect to : 
  * A larger or more tech-savvy customer base ( the dataset is a tech data ).
  * Greater disposable income.
  * Possibly more marketing or brand presence in that city.
    
**Recommendations Based on Sales by Hour and City**
 **Focus Marketing Efforts on Peak Hours (15:00–20:00)**
* Run targeted ads, push notifications, and email campaigns between **3 PM and 8 PM**, when most users are actively purchasing.
* Use countdown promotions or limited-time offers during this window to create urgency.

**Prioritize High-Performing Cities like San Francisco**
* Increase inventory availability and delivery options in **San Francisco**, where demand is strongest.
* Consider **location-based promotions** for other top cities like **Los Angeles** and **New York City**.

**Boost Visibility in Underperforming Cities**
* For cities with low sales (e.g., **Austin, Portland, Seattle**), explore localized marketing strategies:
  * Collaborate with local influencers.
  * Offer city-specific discounts.
  * Translate ads or tailor messaging if needed.

**Optimize Website/App Performance in Evenings**
* Ensure the platform performs smoothly between **15:00 and 21:00**, as high traffic could slow down load times or cause errors, especially in key markets like San Francisco.
* Add a live chat or customer support team during these hours.

**Promote Products Suited for Evenings**
* Feature products often bought in the evening (e.g., home appliances, entertainment devices, phones).
* Showcase “Work-from-home” or “Evening Relaxation” bundles.

# 2. Orger by Hour 
![hour and order](orderhour.png)

**Low Activity (0:00–6:00 AM):**
 * Orders are very low, especially between 2 AM and 5 AM (the lowest point).
  * This is expected as most users are likely inactive during these hours.

** Increase (6:00–10:00 AM):**
  * Orders start rising sharply from 6 AM and peak around 10–11 AM.
  * This suggests that users become active in the morning, possibly during work hours or while planning their day.

**Midday Plateau (11:00 AM–1:00 PM):**
  * Orders remain high and stable during this period — possibly lunchtime usage.

**Afternoon Dip (1:00–4:00 PM):**
  * There's a noticeable decline in orders during early afternoon.

**Evening Peak (5:00–9:00 PM):**
  * Orders rise again and **peak at around 8 PM**, indicating a strong preference for evening activity — likely after work hours.

**Late-Night Decline (9:00 PM–11:00 PM):**
  * After 9 PM, there's a steady decline in order volume.

#  **Recommendations:**
 **Marketing & Promotions:**
 **Focus promotions and ads between 9 AM–1 PM** and **5 PM–9 PM**, when user activity is highest.
* Avoid running ads/promotions during early morning (2–5 AM) when activity is lowest.

 **Operational Planning:**
* *Staff customer service teams more heavily during peak hours**, especially 10 AM–1 PM and 6 PM–9 PM.
* Reduce staffing or automate services during the early morning hours.

**Inventory & System Readiness:**
* Ensure high-demand products or services are well-stocked and system performance is optimized before the **morning and evening spikes**.

 **A/B Testing Campaigns:**
* Test different messaging or product placements during **midday dip (2 PM–4 PM)** to try  improving engagement during this slower period.

 **Push Notifications or Emails:**
* Schedule **email/push notifications** slightly **before** the peak times (e.g., 8 AM and 4:30 PM) to catch users before they start ordering.

# Interpretation of the Most Sold Products

![top product sold ](soldproduct.png)

 **Top Sold Products:**
1. **AAA Batteries (4-pack)** – \~5000 units
2. **AA Batteries (4-pack)** – \~4700 units
3. **Charging Cables**:
       * **Lightning Charging Cable** – \~3800 units
       * **USB-C Charging Cable** – \~3600 units
These are **everyday essentials**, low-cost, high-demand items. They dominate due to their frequent need and affordability.

 **Mid-Tier Sellers:**
* **Wired Headphones**, **Apple Airpods Headphones**, **Bose Soundsport Headphones**
* **Monitors** (27in FHD, Ultrawide, Gaming)
* **Smartphones** (iPhone, Google Phone)
These are **consumer electronics** that combine functionality and moderate cost. They show strong but not top-tier sales.

 **Lower Sales Products:**
* **Laptops** (Macbook Pro, ThinkPad)
* **Flat-screen TVs**
* **Large Appliances**: LG Dryer, LG Washing Machine
* **20in Monitor, Vareebadd Phone**
These products are **higher in price and purchased less frequently**, hence lower unit sales.

#  Recommendations:
* Keep **large inventory** of top-selling essentials like batteries and charging cables.
* Bundle them (e.g., offer a battery + cable combo) for upselling.
* Promote **mid-tier products** (headphones, monitors) during seasonal sales or tech events. These have high potential for conversion.
* Consider **accessory bundling** (e.g., headphones + phone).
* Though low in quantity, laptops and washing machines likely yield **higher margins**.
* Consider targeted marketing or **installment plans** to encourage purchase.
* Review why items like the **Vareebadd Phone** or **LG Washing Machine** are underperforming, like : Poor reviews , Expensive or Not well marketed?
* You might consider:
       * Discontinuing these products
       * Offering discounts
       * Improving product visibility
